          In the ever-evolving landscape of medical and aesthetic professionals
          opening their own start-ups leaving their corporate jobs, we
          recognized a critical need for support beyond our clinical and
          aesthetic expertise. Our journey began with a vision to redefine how
          entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of state compliance,
          administration and finding affordable medical directors, allowing for
          our clients to focus on what they do best while scaling their
          business.

          experience and education pave the way for them to be head of their own
          operations. Whether it's a small independent med spa or a
          multi-specialty clinic, we are dedicated to supporting our clients at
          every step of their journey.
